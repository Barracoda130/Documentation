## Naming Conventions
**Class**: Upper camel casing: `LargeClassName`
**Variable**: Lower camel casing: `variableName`
Try to make all names descriptive and nice to use.

## Getters and Setters
- Should be used to mutate and return variables
- Setters should throw an exception if an incorrect value is passed
